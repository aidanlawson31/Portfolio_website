In 1982 The first internet connection was made By a man named Kilnam Chon. The connection was later named SDN.
Kilnam Chon is a Japanese-born South Korean computer scientist. 

In 1988, the first internet exchange point, was established by connecting TCP/IP networks. 

In 1988 Daniel Karrenberg, a German computer scientist, created the first Internet Service Provider.

in 1989 the World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee, an English computer scientist.

And in 1991 The WWW was made available to the public.

In 1994 The first website was created, interestingly enough, for the Whitehouse.

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, since 1990 HTTP has been used to enable communication, between "servers", and "clients". 

A Web Server can be software or hardware, that's purpose is dedicated to running, or hosting websites. The server processes the HTTP requests.

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique number that is assigned to each device on the internet. Everytime you enter a website you need the IP that belongs to the web server that is hosting the webpage.

A DNS (Domain Name System) name allows us to call a webpage by a name, rather than an IP Address.

So a client, or web browser, makes a request to the server, via a URL, A DNS finds the associated IP Adress, sends the request
for a webpage the server, and then the server returns a response, in the form of a webpage.

To me, the availability of medical help, mental or physical through online articles, chat rooms, and online doctors, has contributed positively
to the world. By allowing people who live in countries without free healthcare, who would otherwise not be able to help themselves, to get 
that help that they need. This is huge, for the youth and elderly especially.
